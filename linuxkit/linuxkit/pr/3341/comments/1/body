From the open issue:

> The easy fix would be find . -type f -name kernel, but I am wondering if we shouldn't be concerned there could be other files somewhere in the image named kernel? Should we be a bit smarter about it at this point and perhaps do find /boot -type f -name kernel? Maybe something else?

Thoughts? @dave-tucker @ijc @justincormack @rn @ijc ?
