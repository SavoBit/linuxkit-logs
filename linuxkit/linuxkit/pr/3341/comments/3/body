as per https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit/blob/master/kernel/Dockerfile#L118 the kernel is always called `kernel`. This did not used to be the case but seem to have been the case since 2017-07-11 (or commit `e0a8a1d4df`). I'd say, if you run kernels that old you have other issues, and would be fine to break that "backwards compatibility"
