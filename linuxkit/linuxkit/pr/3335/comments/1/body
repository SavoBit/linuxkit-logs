@nakato thanks for the patch (and @dprotaso for testing it).

@nakato could you add another commit to this PR to update the hash in src/cmd/linuxkit/moby/output.go? You can get the hash with the `linuxkit` utility:
```
linuxkit pkg show-tag tools/mkimage-rpi3
```
 Once this PR is updated, I will build and sign the packge and a `linuxkit` binary from build from the merged PR should pick up the new firmware.
