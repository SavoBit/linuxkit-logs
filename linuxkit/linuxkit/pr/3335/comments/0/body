**- What I did**
Update commit hash to include updated RPi firmware

**- How to verify it**
Attempt to boot a RPi and expect the power LED to remain on, and ACT to not flash with a debug code.  If successful, expect uboot to log to both serial consol and HDMI.

**- Description for the changelog**
Vendor RPi firmware blob license
Update RPi3 firmware to fix startup on newer kit

This is a potential fix for #3324, however the fix will be when the new image is updated in `src/cmd/linuxkit/moby/output.go`.  I assume this must merge before an image is produced that can provide an updated hash for `src/cmd/linuxkit/moby/output.go`?

The kernel also panics and dumps out HDMI but not serial for me, so there is more that needs to be done, in a different PR, to get a RPi 3B+ booting.
