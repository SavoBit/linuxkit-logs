**- What I did**

`dockerRun` method was called with trust=true only. `linuxkit build` didn't respect the `-disable-content-trust` parameter in the output phase.

Hopefully it will fix this error (even if a previous docker pull succeeded, even with content trust disabled):
`time="2019-08-07T18:01:02Z" level=fatal msg="Error writing outputs: Error writing kernel+iso output: docker pull linuxkit/mkimage-iso:3d81e29b28ddf739becf10758eb6077b198d26d8 failed: exit status 1 output:\n"`

We have it once a day on the Docker Desktop CI.

**- How I did it**

Pass the trust parameter.

**- How to verify it**

`linuxkit -v build` with and without parameter `-disable-content-trust`. A log will appear when creating output.
