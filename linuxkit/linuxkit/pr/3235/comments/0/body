**- What I did**
Add config flags to allow "linuxkit run qemu" to mount host USB devices.

**- How I did it**
The "usb" flag enables the qemu USB host controller, and "devices" multi-flag to specify each device added. This doesn't work for "containerized" qemu runs since that requires passing devices to docker as well.

**- How to verify it**
`linuxkit run qemu -usb -device usb-ehci,id=ehci -device usb-host,vendorid=0x0001,productid=0x0001`

**- Description for the changelog**
Add USB host devices to linuxkit qemu run
