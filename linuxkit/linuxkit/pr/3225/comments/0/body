This restructures the `linuxkit build` subcommand to:
- stash the kernel image in an internal buffer
- add a new `-vmlinux` build option to decompress the kernel
- decompress the kernel into an internal buffer

It also updates `crosvm` to the latest commit and updates the instructions to use the `-vmlinux` build option.

The resulting vmlinux image is binary identical to using the `extract-vmlinux` script from the Lnux kernel `./script` directory. The resulting kernel boots fine on `crosvm` but there is no interactive console (same as with manually extracting the kernel).

The support is experimental in the sense that it assume the fist gzip header found in the vmlinux image is the kernel image and that we do not check the resulting vminux image.

resolves #3215
