restructured the code:
- make it easier to add additional kernel image formats
- more sanity checks on bzImage images

The code still errors if a uncompressed image is used and `--decompress-kernel` is used, which I think is ok.

Also fixed up the `crosvm` README with the updated `linuxkit build` commandline which I forgot in the prefix revision.
