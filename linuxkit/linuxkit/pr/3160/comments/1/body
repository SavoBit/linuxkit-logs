Thanks for the analysis and the patches!

Do you have an idea if this also affects arm64 and s390x (I would suspect it does) so we probably should also add these changes to the respective kernel configs. You could check the configs with `make ARCH=arm64 oldconfig` and `make ARCH=s390 oldconfig`.

The other slight concern I have with modularising the network subsystem is that currently the LCOW build drops all the kernel modules as they are not needed. If we  modularising the network subsystem we'd have to pull in all the kernel module making the LCOW initrd quite a big bigger (6MB -> 22MB), but I guess that would be offset by the faster container start up times.
