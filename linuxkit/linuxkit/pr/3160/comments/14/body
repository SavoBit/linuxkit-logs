The purpose of `NO_HZ_*` is to mitigate the performance overheads (esp on virtualised platforms) from having a higher HZ value, rather than something you would expect to effect the benchmark here directly. The interesting measurement would be the amount of VCPU time used when running virtualised before and after this change (and on an idle vs active system).

A performance issue of this sort (or other unreasonable overhead/obvious inefficiency etc) is certainly something should be reported, whether it is strictly "a bug" or not (IMHO).
