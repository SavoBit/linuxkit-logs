It may be worth testing the performance of arm64 and s390 to see how they fare compared to x86.  I had a colleague anecdotally report acceptable performance on x86-64 using 300Hz instead of 1000Hz.  I'm re-spinning a 4.17 kernel with that clock rate instead to see how it compares to the 1000Hz kernel.
