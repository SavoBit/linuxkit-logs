Sorry I wasn't clear about this.  I attempted to call out the individual improvement of each patch against baseline, but may not have gotten all of that from the commit messages into the PR's description.

In the case of 4.14, just applying the HZ patch takes us from 2000ms -> 570ms, and just applying the modules patch takes us from 2000ms -> 1260ms.  If you combine both, then you can go from 2000ms -> 450ms.  On 4.17, we need just the HZ patch, and that takes us from 1260ms -> 390ms.
