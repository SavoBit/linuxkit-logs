I didn't test on ARM or S390, mostly due to lack of access to hardware.  AIUI, HZ is valid for all architectures.

I actually suspect that there's a bug in one of the network subsystems that is exacerbating this problem, and converting everything to modules is a workaround until I (or somebody else) can track down the culprit.  Note that on 4.9 and 4.17, the container launch times are in the 1200ms range, so globally applying HZ, and only converting modules on 4.14 is one possibility.

OTOH, if switching everything to using modules is particularly obnoxious, it might be possible to see if the issues in 4.14 can be fixed by backporting the appropriate patches.  (Means that we'll have to figure out exactly what in the setup_net() path is taking all that time.  Although, with the HZ changed, it means we only need to recover 120ms or so to reach parity with the other releases.)
