We have CONFIG_NO_HZ_IDLE which turns off the tick when idle which I think is the more important thing wrt CPU consumption, so fine by me in that respect.

Although, since RCU is the motivation for this change have we checked if any of the other RCU settings/modes might be a worthwhile improvement without switching to such a fast clock?

(this all has the slight whiff of working around a kernel bug, has this been reported upstream?)
