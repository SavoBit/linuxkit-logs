I do like having this, thank you @johanneswuerbach 

There were some issues with `qemu-s390x-static` not working correctly. I came across them most recently when I was working to get calico cross-platform, but I cannot recall what they were at the moment. It has been a bit of time, but I found my own (unfortunately cryptic) comment [here](https://github.com/projectcalico/typha/blob/0bd59769525663f6e22866d9ba987d1c7ad1ecb5/Makefile#L75), but cannot recall what the issues were. Something about binaries giving a strange SIGSEGV due to qemu emulation issues? The exclusion exists in every calico project, I remember having to exclude it, but cannot recall the details now.

I do recall that we worked with @alicefr on it, as well as @mkumatag . Does either of you recall what the qemu s390x issues were?
