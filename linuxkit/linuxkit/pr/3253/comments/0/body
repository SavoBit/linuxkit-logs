**- What I did**

Register s390x with binfmt_misc and add the static qemu s390x binary. Docker already provides
official images for s309x (but no official support).

https://github.com/docker-library/official-images#architectures-other-than-amd64

**- How I did it**

While the process wasn't really documented before, I added some details around adding an architecture.

**- How to verify it**

```
docker build -t binfmt ./pkg/binfmt
docker run --rm -it --privileged binfmt
docker run --rm -it s390x/debian:stretch uname -a
Linux 989516accfdd 4.9.125-linuxkit #1 SMP Fri Sep 7 08:20:28 UTC 2018 s390x GNU/Linux
```
