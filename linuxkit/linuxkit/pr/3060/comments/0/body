The main commit is:
```
    While we can re-create the kernel source code we don't have it
    handily available in one place. This commit stashes the kernel
    and the WireGuard source as /src/linux.tar.xz and
    /src/wireguard.tar.xz in the kernel package.

    This increases the size of the hub image by around 100MB.
```
In addition, I also added `-f` to the `curl` invocations which were missing it.
