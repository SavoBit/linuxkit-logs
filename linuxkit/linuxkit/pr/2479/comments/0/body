We need to add the addresses first and then set the routes, that way if the private ip gets added last, we're not setting the private ip as the default route
And using netlink.Bond to create the bondded interface is more readable, I think.

**- What I did**
Cleaned up the packet metadata.

**- How I did it**
Created the bond0 interface using the netlink.Bond struct.  
Add addresses and then setup routes in two discreet loops, that way the private IP doesn't end up being the last route that's added.

**- How to verify it**
Run on a Packet Type 0 server.
