Sure!  Sorry, I haven't responded much.  Been busy.  Also, I got stuck on getting the default gateway to work for some reason.  Running the binary directly on the host worked, but wouldn't work inside the metadata container even though the metadata container has `CAP_NET_ADMIN` and `/dev` is mounted in it.
