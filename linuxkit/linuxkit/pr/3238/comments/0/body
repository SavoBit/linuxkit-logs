**- What I did**
Added support for named pipes in based images.

**- How I did it**
`pkg/init/cmd/init/init.go` to allow ` os.ModeNamedPipe` on rootfs

**- How to verify it**
Use RHEL based image for a service, and run it.

**- Description for the changelog**
Allow based images that use named pipes, for example RHEL descendants that use named pipe in /dev for systemd.
