@kppk apologies, this seems to have fallen down the cracks. Could you please rebase this PR to the latest?

Could you then also update all instances of `linuxkit/init` in the YAML files with the output of `linuxkit pkg show-tag .` executed in the `./pkg/init` directory. This will cause CI to pick up these changes. CI will fail, but I'll update push an updated `init` package and kick CI.

Thanks
