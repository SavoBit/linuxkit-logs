**- What I did**

Note there is a confusing name clash between the `pkg/logwrite` package which writes logs to disk and the command-line wrapper program `cmd/logwrite` (part of the `memlogd` package) modified here.

In e8786d73bb5665b4d548781949e318af6967be03 the logwrite package will automatically append .log to every log filename.

In 5201049f2ccb92d3933ab39f1a1a498c09dda669 the init package will send stderr of a service `s` to a log named `s` and the stdout to `s.out`. Therefore the files we create on disk are `s.log` and `s.out.log`.

This patch modifies the memlogd `logwrite` command-line wrapper to use the same convention.


**- How to verify it**

```
/ # ./pkg/memlogd/cmd/logwrite/logwrite -n hello ls /fooo
/ # ls -1 /var/log
...
hello.log
...
/ # cat /var/log/hello.log
2018-07-20T14:46:45Z hello ls: cannot access '/fooo': No such file or directory
```

**- Description for the changelog**
The `logwrite` command-line wrapper now follows the same logging convention as the `init` package.
