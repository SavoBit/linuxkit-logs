the cherry pick failed as mentioned. But there were no other changes but it was due to other patches having been cherry picked so the change itself is find but the patch failed because the line above had changed. I manually tweaked the patch and added a comment to the commit (as well as a signed-off-by for the change).

And yes, focussing on bumping to 4.14 would be better ;)
