These patches should be pulled into linuxkit/linux on the appropriate branch and then `git format-patch` should be used, See https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit/blob/master/docs/kernels.md#working-with-linux-kernel-patches-for-linuxkit

If you give me the upstream commits (from linux-stable) I can add them to the relevant 4.9.x branch (or we just pick them up with the next kernel update).

However, for kernel updates seem to be stuck behind https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit/pull/3170
