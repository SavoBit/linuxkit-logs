@djs55 when I tried b1b9d366028ff580e6dd80b48a69c473361456f1 it did not apply (cherry pick) cleanly to the v4.9.124-linuxkit branch (see https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit/pull/3174#issuecomment-418185317). Maybe it needs another patch to be cherry picked as well. I may have some time wednesday to look into it
