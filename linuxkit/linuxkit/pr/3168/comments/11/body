@medic15 @justincormack I still don't understand the use case and why such a one-off can't be added to the end of the `onboot` with some bash script that would wait for redis to come up. Hopefully you can help clarify.

In any case, I've added a boolean flag `noRestart` to the `runtime` configuration section than can disable the restart. PTAL!
