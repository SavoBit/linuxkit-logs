@medic15 and @justincormack are correct, this needs to be configurable per service.

I still have concerns regarding this use of a plugin which is "The usecase is for system level containers" and "Its not built for the kube or docker restart policies, just a simple internal function to keep low level system containers running". Whether or not it happens to currently meet the use case here if we are using it outside its "support envelope" we have no guarantee that it will continue to be suitable in the future. I'd be happy to be overruled by the other maintainers on that though.
