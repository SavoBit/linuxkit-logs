Long running services are typically ones where any exit code would be anomalous. Yes, we need to continue to support one off execution. This change would obviously change that and restart each `service` that has exited. One off executables are still supported and probably better served under the `onboot` section of the runtime definition where there is reliable execution ordering for dependencies. This would provide reliable long running services to Linuxkit without the need to restart the whole system. Besides, I think it would be interesting to have a `service` that exits as part of its nominal behavior be monitored by this change to implement watchdogs or custom polling functionality.
