https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/2318 shows it using `container.Update` to set it after starting, also  using `WithNoRestart` on teardown. However I'm not completely convinced this is intended for this use case. From https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/2318#issuecomment-385981173:
> The usecase is for system level containers, it will allow remote snapshotters, runtimes, and such to be kept running without any external deps on a system. Its not built for the kube or docker restart policies, just a simple internal function to keep low level system containers running, maybe something like kubelet in a container ;)

It seems like it is for containerd internal functionality not 3rd party use (as much as some linuxkit containers could be considered "system level containers").
