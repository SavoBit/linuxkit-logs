**- What I did**
The PR has 3 commits:
1. A losetup utility container allowing to setup a loop device backed by a regular file, including test and docs
2. A dm-crypt container allowing to map an device with dm-crypt including tests and docs
3. A couple of examples

Obviously I have no access to the linuxkit hub so a contributor would have to built+push the containers (all .yml files assume that this will happen as they use linuxkit/... images)

**- How I did it**
Tried to follow https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit/blob/master/docs/packages.md and practices and structure of the other existing packages.

**- How to verify it**
Build it locally with: 
```
linuxkit pkg build pkg/losetup
linuxkit pkg build pkg/dm-crypt

linuxkit build -format kernel+initrd examples/dm-crypt.yml
linuxkit run -disk size=20M dm-crypt
```

**- Description for the changelog**
Adding support and examples for loop device and dm-crypt support

**- A picture of a cute animal (not mandatory but encouraged)**
