Overall, I like this idea. I had planned at some point to make it able to boot off an encrypted filesystem, and then eventually store/retrieve keys from tpm, but haven't found the time yet.

I have a few small comments (inline).

Separately, CI is failing, but that looks like trust issues, mainly because the images don't exist and weren't pushed out.

Like to get some comments from the other maintainers, in addition to these.

Nice work!
