I also think some of the docs should go in [docs/](https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit/tree/master/docs) rather than in the specific `pkg/`. Someone who already knows about crypt or losetup will look there, but someone looking to answer, "how can I do a loopback device" or "how can I use an encrypted filesystem" will start by going to [docs/](https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit/tree/master/docs)
