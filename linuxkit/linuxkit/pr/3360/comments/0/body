**- What I did**

Simplify a long method by extracting code inside the for-loop.

My goal is to open a follow-up PR that will log the time required to execute onboot/shutdown services. It will be useful in Docker Desktop for getting a better knowledge on "Why the boot is slow?"

**- How I did it**

Extract the method, use `fmt.Errorf` to carry the information.

**- How to verify it**
