Hi,
As the directory "sources" does not exist curl failed to write the downloaded kernels into it. Add a "RUN mkdir sources" before solve the problem, or use the "--create-dirs" option of curl.
I tested it on MacOS 10.14.5 with curl 7.54.0 and on Linux 3.10 with curl 7.29.0, on both systems I had this issue.
