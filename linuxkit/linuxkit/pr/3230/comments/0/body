**- What I did**
This PR adds [bpftrace](https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace) as a package to linuxkit. It includes all the necessary components and directory structures in order to build a bpftrace inside of a docker container.

Addresses: https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit/issues/3201

**- How I did it**
I started off by looking at existing packages for a reference model of how to structure a package in linuxkit. I also read the https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit/blob/master/docs/packages.md doc.

You can build it locally to test it out using the following command:
```linuxkit pkg build -org=<orgname> -disable-content-trust <path/to/bpftrace>```
