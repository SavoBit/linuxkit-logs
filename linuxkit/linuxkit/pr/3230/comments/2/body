Thanks for importing, this. But as @justincormack said, could you please follow a pattern similar to the other packages which have a `Dockerfile` which check out a specific revision of the source code and then compile it. If you look at the `bpftrace` `Dockerfile` is basically just installs the too chain, which should already be present in the `linuxkit/alpine` package, and then calls `build.sh`
