In terms of usage, you can look at the documentation for things like `perf`

Essentially include the pkg in the `init:` section for your image, and then in a running image do `nsenter -t1 -a bpftrace -l`

And a potential harness for testing it https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit/tree/master/test/cases/040_packages/032_bcc though you might want to use some of the tests in here https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace/blob/master/tests/probe.cpp#L52 to validate if it actually works
