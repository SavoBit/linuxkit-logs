Although this now runs as expected, I'm curious if this means we'd need a custom kernel with appropriate debug capabilities. For instance this is an example run that should've listed some probes.

```
docker run -it bpftrace -l
No such file or directory: /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/available_filter_functions
```
