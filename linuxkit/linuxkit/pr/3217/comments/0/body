**- What I did**

Allowed for modprobe modules to load firmware files.

**- How I did it**

Made /lib/firmware available in the modprobe container and also added capabilities all. This last bit I'm really not sure of, but try as hard as I may the CAP_SYS capabilities don't seem to allow for kernel to load firmware files from the filesystem. I think it should be fine for this pkg, but would appreciate any guidance on how to make it more granular.

**- How to verify it**

Modprobe any WiFi driver that requires a firmware

**- Description for the changelog**

Allowed for modprobe modules to load firmware files.
