@justincormack I was hoping somebody on this thread could pinpoint precisely the CAP I need for this. So far I tried a union of CAP_SYS_ADMIN | CAP_SYS_MODULE | CAP_SYS_RAWIO and it still doesn't allow me to load the firmware from within modprobe container. The all, of course, does. Let me poke some more -- but I'd really appreciate if anyone suggest what is really needed here.
