@justinbarrick since Qemu started supporting Hypervisor.Framework on OSX its actually much faster to run it natively than in a container as you get full hardware acceleration, so I kind of changed my mind about this. But if it is useful we can leave it (my thought it was more confusing as it might run differently without being obvious why not).
