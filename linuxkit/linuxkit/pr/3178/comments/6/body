you can't run "nested" on macOS. The qemu in the (linux) container almost certainly does not have the acceleration compiled in for HVF (and wn't be able to use it even if one could map this in somehow).

If we run qemu containerised on Linux we mount in `/dev/kvm` if present so you'd get acceleration there even if run in a container
