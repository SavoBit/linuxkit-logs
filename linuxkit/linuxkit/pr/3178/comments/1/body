One nice thing about Qemu in Docker is that it removes any risk of version differences and also means that users do not need to separately install Qemu (for example, on Mac OS, that's an extra brew install).

Not sure if this is is important for you, but thought I'd mention it as I've found it useful to package Qemu in Docker myself.
