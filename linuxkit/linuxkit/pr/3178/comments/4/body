We used to use the containerized version on CI (until we installed qemu in the CI machines and also enabled nested virt). I've seen CI failures which were not reproducible with accelerated qemu (both on KVM and HVF) and saw mixed results with TCG. So having a known baseline version might be useful. OTOH, we had issues/regressions with running qemu containerised in the past and we don't really test it. Removing this option would clean up the code a bit too.

So I'm in two minds about removing it, but wouldn't object merging this unless someone has a strong opinion otherwise.
