**- What I did**
Updated the compose project as follows:

* remove `rm` of pre-loaded tar files in static as they are in a read-only filesystem
* Updated docker version to `18.06`
* Bumped memory for static in Makefile's `run-static` target to handle the larger file
* Added `getty` to the compose examples
* Removed static list of images from `Makefile` and just looked for them dynamically in the compose file


**- How I did it**

Changed the `linuxprojects/compose` image, updated and pushed, then changed the `Makefile` and the two linuxkit ymls

**- How to verify it**
For both static and dynamic, build the `lkt` images, run them, check the output:

1. build: `make static` or `make dynamic`
2. run: `make run-static` or `make run-dynamic`
3. Wait for the console to come up
4. Check the logs in `/var/log/compose.log` and `/var/log/compose.out.log` - it takes a few moments for docker to start up, and then (in dynamic case) for it to download the images
5. Exec into docker container: `ctr -n services.linuxkit t exec --tty --exec-id 999 docker sh`
6. List the containers running: `docker ps`. Expect output as follows (with different timestamps and IDs, of course):

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                NAMES
