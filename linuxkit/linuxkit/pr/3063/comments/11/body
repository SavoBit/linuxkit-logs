Ah, its a conflict with the power change in https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit/pull/3030

Could you:
- drop the hash update commit
- rebase to master
- force push

I will then rebuild the init package and give you a new hash

can you then add a commit with the update of the YAMLs.

Sorry, but the way the hashes work we need to go though this again, but shouldn't take long

Thanks
