I think that adding `stop` and `restart` is a good thing. I have some suggestions on the structure though. 

1. Why the `switch args[0]` statement [here in main.go](https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit/pull/3063/files#diff-d97c24f85a236f43d00bbda743ed98e0R102) and then another [here in start.go](https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit/pull/3063/files#diff-ff45df16bbcd1fbb7b9b7370398c6b50R50), when they basically do the same thing? Might as well just have the single one in `main.go` call the relevant `func` directly.
2. We should rename `start.go` to `cmd.go` if it will have `start`, `stop`, and `restart`; or alternatively have separate files `start.go`, `stop.go` and `restart.go`, each with its own `func`. Either way, match the filename to what it does.

That is about it.
