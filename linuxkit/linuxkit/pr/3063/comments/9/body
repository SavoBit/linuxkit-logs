@justinbarrick I've build and pushed an updated `linuxkit/init` package with this change for x86, arm64, and s390x. Could you add a commit to this PR to update the hashes in the YAML files?

There is script, so something like this from the top level directory should do the right thing:
```
./scripts/update-component-sha.sh --image linuxkit/init:9c91a7f714d84ef5f7aac8ec31536db9001d9930
```

Once you pushed the new commit, CI should pick it up and hopefully it will pass
