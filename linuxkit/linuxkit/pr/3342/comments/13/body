@carlosedp, while this is solved, you can try project [dbhi/qus](https://github.com/dbhi/qus#usage): `docker run --rm --privileged aptman/qus -s -- -p [TARGET_ARCH]`.

In dbhi/qus I am using http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/q/qemu/ or https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org/packages/qemu/. I believe it is a much lighter approach than installing packages through a package manager, since a lighter base container can be used. The drawback is that the autenticity is not verified.

Regarding this PR, I do believe that the best approach is to wait for @StefanScherer to upstream https://github.com/docker/binfmt/blob/master/binfmt/Dockerfile. Building QEMU from sources with all those custom flags (https://github.com/docker/binfmt/blob/master/binfmt/Dockerfile#L22-L50) is the way to go in order to optimize the size of the image.
