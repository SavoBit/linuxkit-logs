Hi, thanks for the investigation and this PR.

With LinuxKit we try to avoid downloading random binaries without verifying their authenticity. This i would to either build this from source (via git checkout and known toolchain) or, if we download a binary at a minimum verify the hash, or better set up the install to verify package signatures
