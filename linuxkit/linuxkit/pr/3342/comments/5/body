Docker Desktop is currently building 3.1.0 from https://github.com/moby/qemu from source via a .deb intermediate package using scripts from https://github.com/tuonga/moby-qemu-scripts . I think @StefanScherer is looking at simplifying and tidying up the build. Hopefully we'll have something clean enough to upstream (e.g. a nice source build from a `Dockerfile`)
