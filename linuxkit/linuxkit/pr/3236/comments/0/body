**- What I did**
To improve availability, adds watchdog to `service` containers so that if they are restarted if they are not in the "RUNNING" state. If the service is explicitly stopped, it will remove the watchdog.

**- How I did it**
Using containerd restart watchdog plugin

**- How to verify it**
Add a service that exists and check restart attempts are logged under `/var/log/<service>.restart.log`
Stop the service and verify that it no longer is restarted

**- Description for the changelog**
Enable containerd restart plugin for improved system service availability
