This PR:
- removes support for 4.4.x kernel (resolves #3250)
- Adds support for 4.20.x kernels for x86_64, arm64, and s390x
  - the 4.20.x kernel config was derived from the v4.19.13 kernel config with the defaults accepted
  - enabled support for the STACKLEAK GCC plugin for x86_64/arm54
  - enabled the ENA driver for arm64 (wip #3251)

While at it, simplify the perf/bcc builds. It sitll doesn't compile for for newer kernels on arm64 but since we don't support 4.4.x anymore, just check for 4.9.x.
