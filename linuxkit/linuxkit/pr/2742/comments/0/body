**- What I did**

Added deduplication logic to `linuxkit/getty` so that if the same line appears twice as `console=`, it will only start each once.

Also logs what it is doing.

Fixed [2741](https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit/issues/2741)

**- How I did it**
Updated `/usr/bin/rungetty.sh`

**- How to verify it**

1. Run a linuxkit `.yml` file with duplicate `console=` lines

```yml
  cmdline: "console=tty0 console=ttyS0 console=ttyAMA0 console=ttyS0 console=tty0"
```

2. `moby build`
3. `linuxkit run`
4. Log in, see that `/var/log/getty.out.log` shows it starting only once. Also verify with `ps -ef` if you want.
