This PR adds initial support for reproducible `linuxkit build`s (wip #2813).

- Files created during the build have their timestamp fixed
- Slices/Arrays are sorted before being marshalled to JSON

Currently, the `tar`, `tar-kernel-initrd`, `docker`, and `kernel+initrd` output formats support reproducible builds and tests for `tar` and `kernel+initrd` are added with this PR.
