This is _rather_ nice!

Is there concern that the modtime now is just the timestamp that lkt open sourced? Might we want to have a cmdline option to set the date-time as an input, with a default for that time, and maybe an option that says, "now"?

E.g. 

```
$ lkt build --modtime now ...
$ lkt build --modtime 20181229T175500Z ...
```

Or `-timestamp` or some other flag name, but that idea? And if not specified, just uses the date/time lkt was open-sourced?
