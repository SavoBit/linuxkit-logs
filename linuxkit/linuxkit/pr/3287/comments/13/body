I had a hypothesis overnight which is that the tests are using `/tmp` not the `cwd`.

```console
(ns: sshd) linuxkit-4e725ef9a167:~# df -h /tmp
Filesystem                Size      Used Available Use% Mounted on

```
I guess user xattrs and tmpfs don't mix. http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/tmpfs.5.html seems to confirm:
>       The tmpfs filesystem supports extended attributes (see xattr(7)), but
>       user extended attributes are not permitted.

Although my local `tmpfs(5)` doesn't have those words.

I'm going to investigate whether the tests will obey `$TMP`/`$TMPDIR` etc as my first attempt to confirm/fix. If not then I will arrange for `/tmp` to be on the persistent disk for this container.
