https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/master/archive/tar.go#L414 is the line producing the error, but it is ancient not new in v1.2.3.

Actual thing which (I reckon) broke us is https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/2244a20c446c7b06967268e1edf7a4246cabd41a but that's just making xattrs work at all -- so I think the core issue is the `setxattr` failing on our kernels. I've no idea why that should be. Maybe it's the underlying fs?
