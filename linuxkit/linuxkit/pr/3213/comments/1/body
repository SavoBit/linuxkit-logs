Just wondering if any of the formats that use these currently require an empty `cmdline` file? eg looks like https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit/blob/master/tools/mkimage-qcow2-efi/make-efi will error (as it has `set -e`) if the cmdline file is missing. Should be easy enough to fix to accept an empty file.
