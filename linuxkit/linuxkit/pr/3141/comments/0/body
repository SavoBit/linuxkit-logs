**- What I did**

While processing the content of a tar image, linuxkit's moby tool was
blindly reusing the original tar format.

Moreover it locates the file under a new prefix, so if the original
file was stored as USTAR in the original archive, the filename length
and new prefix could be greater than the USTAR limit leading
to a fatal error.

**- How I did it**

The fix is to always enforce PAX format on all copied files from the
original image archive.

**- How to verify it**

Use the following minimal yaml:
~~~yaml
kernel:
  image: linuxkit/kernel:4.9.87
  cmdline: "console=ttyS0"
init:
  - linuxkit/init:6061875ba11fd9c563fda6234b103ed9997ff782
  - linuxkit/runc:52ecfdef1ae051e7fd5ac5f1d0b7dd859adff015
  - linuxkit/containerd:13f62c61f0465fb07766d88b317cabb960261cbb
onboot:
  - name: dhcpcd
    image: linuxkit/dhcpcd:v0.2
    command: ["/sbin/dhcpcd", "--nobackground", "-f", "/dhcpcd.conf", "-1"]
services:
  # Enable getty for easier debugging
  - name: getty
    image: linuxkit/getty:44730fd0a7c59dbacf5b48b54ba33f551bcf7ef0
    env:
        - INSECURE=true
  - name: elasticsearch

      - xpack.security.enabled=false
