**- What I did**
This adds a new configuration provider that just reads a file.
This is needed for Docker Desktop, where we will run a LinuxKit distro in an isolated namespace within WSL 2.
In this scenario, the config will be accessible trough the WSL2 built-in 9p mount of the Windows filesystem.

**- How I did it**
If no provider match the first command line argument, and there is an actual file at this location, it directly read the json payload from it

**- How to verify it**
- Create a LinuxKit image with a static config file in it
- Add an onboot metadata service passing the path to this file as an argument
- Check that /run/config is correctly populated

**- Description for the changelog**

Machine configuration can now be read directly from a file
