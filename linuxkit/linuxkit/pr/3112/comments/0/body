This adds most of the packages needed to add the iovisor/bcc tools to LinuxKit as per #3106.

`python` and `iperf` were omitted as I don't think they are essential. Also `luajit-dev` is not avail on s390x so the build of bcc might need to take that into account (/cc @
kmjohansen).

The new package is: `linuxkit/alpine:cbf183a92cb4800c4129c2b9bb6e4d3eb3226330` and the size increased by about 140MB to about 600MB on x86.
