In addition to bug fixes, this removes the special protocol used for `shutdown` needed by old Windows builds < 14393-- this is of particular interest to `vsudd` which is used to proxy arbitrary socket connections.

**- Description for the changelog**
Update the version of `virtsock` used by `vsudd` to the latest version, removing the old workaround for lack of `shutdown` on Windows builds < 14393.
