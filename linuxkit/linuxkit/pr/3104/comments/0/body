This updates everything to the latest alpine base and all the packages were build and pushed with the v0.5 release tag.

Updated `cadvisor`, `node_exporter` and `firmware`/`firmware-all` to the latest version and added a note to `releasing.md` to do so as part of the next releases (resolves #3099).

The `pkg/tss` build was getting really annoying with sf.net timing out, so mirrored the `tpm-tools` and `trousers` repository to `linuxkit/mirror-tpkm-tools` and `linuxkit/mirror-trousers` for more reliable builds (resolves #3097).

Once this is merged the repository is locked till the version in `./Makefile` is bumped to `v0.5+`
