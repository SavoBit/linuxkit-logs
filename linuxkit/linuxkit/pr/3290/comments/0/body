Containerd release: https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.2.4

Updates runc for CVE-2019-5736.

This also fixes the issue investigated in #3287 (introduced via #3286) by running the containerd tests with a `$TMPDIR` which supports `user_xattrs` (which `/tmp`, a `tmpfs`, does not). While I was there I also updated `test/pkg/containerd` to use the `build.yml` method for specifying the config instead of the old label method (I thought I was going to need to tweak the config, in the end I didn't, but the cleanup is useful anyway).
