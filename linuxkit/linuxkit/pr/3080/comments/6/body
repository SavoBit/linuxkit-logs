Do we need to update the hashes for the `FROM` lines in the `pkg` Dockerfiles? E.g. 

```dockerfile
FROM linuxkit/alpine:1b05307ae8152e3d38f79e297b0632697a30c65c AS mirror
```

And did we ever put in tooling for that? I am not sure if [update-component-sha.sh](https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit/blob/master/scripts/update-component-sha.sh) will handle that correctly, but I think it might.
