This is my very first step into trying to get a port of linuxkit for armv7l (which may not even get anywhere). However, I thought that the issue I encountered (sorry I forget the exact error message, it took me a while to debug) seemed to be with a mismatch between apk and uname, that it was worth fixing for all architectures, since I guess it's just good fortune that it hasn't been spotted before.

As you say, there are plenty of other questions to ask before a full port can be considered.
