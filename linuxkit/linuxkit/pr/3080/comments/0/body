fixes #3079 

**- What I did**
Changed references to `uname -m` in the context of an apk command to `apk --print-arch`

**- How to verify it**
Build tools/alpine with `make` on different architectures

**- Description for the changelog**

When dealing with apk, `uname -m` doesn't always match the architecture
name that apk uses. Instead `apk --print-arch` is used.
