Rather than bind mounting binfmt_misc filesystem, mount a copy.
    
For some reason, bind mounting does not always seem to work,
sometimes the filesystem is empty. Mounting a fresh copy seems
a better solution, and simplifies things. The container does
need `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` but only on boot.

also cherry pick #3071 to use Debian for qemu as Alpine currently broken for networking.

fix #2710
