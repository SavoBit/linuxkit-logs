Update LinuxKit to use Alpine 3.9 almost everywhere.

A few exceptions:
- `mkimage/*efi*` has compilation errors (see https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit/issues/3295). Keep them on 3.8 for now.
- `pkg/bpftrace` does not compile (see https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit/issues/3296). Disable it for now.

This PR also contains two update to `linuxkit/alpine` since I discovered when building the `pkg` that the WireGuard alpine packages got slight restructured.I did not want to rebuild everything else I had build, so only `pkg/*` are build with the very latest `linuxkit/alpine`

Once this update passes CI I'll probably do a release.
