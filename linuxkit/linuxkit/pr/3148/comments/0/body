**- What I did**

For an internal project where I needed to produce a VirtualBox based vagrant box, I started running a linuxkit VM with the `run vbox` command.
This specific VM requires to have an additional disk and two network adapter.

Unfortunately, adding an additional disk produces a VirtualBox error because there's no port 2 on IDE Controller (only port 0 and 1). Also adding more than one additional disk couldn't work because all would have used port 2, and IDE controllers only allow for 4 devices (one 
And `run vbox` only supports one network adapter.

I modified the `run vbox` code to use a SATA controller for any additional disks instead of the IDE controller, because it can host much more drives.

I also changed the code to allow to specify more than one `-networking` parameter. Unfortunately this breaks the backward compatibility with the previous way of setting up the network.
Previously one had to do:
~~~
-networking bridge -bridgeadapter vboxnet0
~~~
and now:
~~~
-networking bridge,bridgeadapter=vboxnet0
# or
-networking type=bridge,adapter=vboxnet0
~~~

**- How I did it**

N/A

**- How to verify it**

One can use the following `build.yml`:
~~~yaml
kernel:
  image: linuxkit/kernel:4.9.87
  cmdline: "console=ttyS0"
init:
  - linuxkit/init:6061875ba11fd9c563fda6234b103ed9997ff782
  - linuxkit/runc:52ecfdef1ae051e7fd5ac5f1d0b7dd859adff015
  - linuxkit/containerd:13f62c61f0465fb07766d88b317cabb960261cbb
onboot:
  - name: dhcpcd
    image: linuxkit/dhcpcd:v0.2
    command: ["/sbin/dhcpcd", "--nobackground", "-f", "/dhcpcd.conf", "-1"]
  - name: static_ip
    image: linuxkit/ip:v0.6
    net: host
    binds:
      - /etc/network/setup.conf:/etc/network/setup.conf
    command: ["ip", "-b", "/etc/network/setup.conf"]
# Format and mount the disk image in /var/lib for persistency
  - name: format
    image: linuxkit/format:v0.4
  - name: mount
    image: linuxkit/mount:v0.4
    command: ["/usr/bin/mountie", "/var/lib"]
services:
  # Enable acpi to shutdown on power events
  - name: acpid
    image: linuxkit/acpid:v0.4
  # Enable getty for easier debugging
  - name: getty
    image: linuxkit/getty:44730fd0a7c59dbacf5b48b54ba33f551bcf7ef0
    env:
        - INSECURE=true
  # Run ntpd to keep time synchronised in the VM
  - name: ntpd
    image: linuxkit/openntpd:v0.4
files:
  - path: /etc/network/setup.conf
    source: "setup.conf"
    mode: "0644"
trust:
  org:
    - linuxkit
    - library

~~~
With `setup.conf` being:
~~~
addr add 192.168.2.200/24 dev eth1
link set eth1 up
~~~

Then build and run the :
~~~
VBoxManage createhd --filename data.vdi --variant Standard --size 10240
linuxkit run vbox -mem 2048 -iso -disk file=data.vdi,size=10240M,format=vdi -networking type=nat -networking type=hostonly,adapter=vboxnet0
~~~

On the console, check that the drive is present and mounted, and that the second hostonly adapter is present and working:
~~~
linuxkit-080027c74f8e:/# mount | grep /var/lib
/dev/sda1 on /var/lib type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=ordered)
linuxkit-080027c74f8e:/# ip addr | grep eth
4: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP qlen 1000
    link/ether 08:00:27:c7:4f:8e brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 10.0.2.15/24 brd 10.0.2.255 scope global eth0
5: eth1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP qlen 1000
    link/ether 08:00:27:0f:10:56 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.2.200/24 scope global eth1
