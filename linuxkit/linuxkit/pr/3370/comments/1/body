The rest of the file uses tabs for indentation. Please use them in your changes too to leave it consistent.

Otherwise the changes look ok.

To speed things up a little, in a separate commit, please change the uses of the `linuxkit/swap` package in all the YAML files with the new tag (output of `linuxkit pkg show-tag .` in the `./pkg/swap` directory). `scripts/update-component-sha.sh` will help with that. The CI will then fail but one of the maintainers can then build and push the new package and re-kick CI
