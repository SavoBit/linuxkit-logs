Ah, so the kernel was being loaded from the SD card to `kernel_addr_r` which is incorrect. I'm not sure why this was working in the older u-boot but this is definitely waht `loadaddr` is for. `kernel_addr_r` is the location that the kernel executes from after being decompressed. I've updated the PR with my working version now.
