**- What I did**
Make Intel microcode available for static build in the kernel using `CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE`

**- How I did it**
Move the code downloading Intel microcode in `kernel/Dockerfile` earlier in the process, and copy it to `/lib/firmware` where Linux build system will look for it.
It is still copied in the `out/` directory and so that it is still available for addition in a 'ucode:' section in linuxkit.yml

**- How to verify it**

Build a kernel with, for instance: 
```
CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE="intel-ucode/06-03-02"
```
and verify that it doesn't complain.

**- Description for the changelog**
Move microcode download earlier in Dockerfile so it's available to `CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE`.
