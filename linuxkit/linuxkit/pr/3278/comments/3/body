I'm not sure we want the `sshd` base layer to be the union of anything anyone might ever want in that context. e.g. we currently IIRC don't include the packages necessary to make `scp` "just work" (or perhaps I'm thinking of `sftp`, either way).

I'd suggest that either you can `apk add -U rsync` on the fly, or your can use `FROM` to build a derivative image for your use case.
