I am not sure why CI gives me this error:
```
Failed to create OCI spec for linuxkit/sshd:a0ac44ab1cbfd14e368ed139c6a4e128f2a33513: Trusted pull for linuxkit/sshd:a0ac44ab1cbfd14e368ed139c6a4e128f2a33513 failed: No valid trust data for a0ac44ab1cbfd14e368ed139c6a4e128f2a33513
```

From previous experience, I recalled that I need to bump all uses of a package in the same PR/commit that introduces the changes to the package itself - does CI now assume that changes are made separately?
