> I'm not sure we want the sshd base layer to be the union of anything anyone might ever want in that context. e.g. we currently IIRC don't include the packages necessary to make scp "just work" (or perhaps I'm thinking of sftp, either way).

Tough call. I tend to agree with this sentiment, but then why do we have the wireguard package installed (see [here](https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit/blob/master/pkg/sshd/Dockerfile#L13))? 

I think this might be easier if there were a simple way for a consumer of `lkt` to just use the standard `linuxkit/sshd` package, but yet have the desired tools made available without having to extend the base. Mounted in? Standardly available dir? Unlike most `pkg/` parts, `sshd` (it keeps auto-correcting to `sushi`) is a CLI, so people will want things in there that they find useful, and so we are likely to get more and more of these, and more and more discussion of what is "standard" and "base" and "commonly used". We definitely _have_ an answer with "extend it in a `Dockerfile` with what you want," but I am wondering if we could have an easier one?
