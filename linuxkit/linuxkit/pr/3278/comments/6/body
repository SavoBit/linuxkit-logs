I just looked at the history; wireguard has been in since July 2017, when it was added to everything else. I don't recall the PR that added it, or the discussions around it, offhand. I do recall other discussions around adding more "standard" packages to getty and sshd, and usually they were held back to keep it minimal.

I would like to see none of it in there, and one of:

* a way to mount in desired `apk` packages (or binaries) from another location, so they can be kept clean
* a way to add them in "on the fly", i.e. during `lkt build`

Either of these essentially comes down to some higher-order form of composition. We already have composition of layers and packages via `Dockerfile` to build OCI images, and we have composition of those images using a `linuxkit.yml` to build OS images via `lkt build`. There is some middle layer here, where lkt can know to do some additional composition.

I am just not sure what that is, and if it is worth it...
