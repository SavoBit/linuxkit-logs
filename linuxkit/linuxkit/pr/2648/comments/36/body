generate sounds good but dont mind changing.

Changed to `linuxkit generate --pkgroot <org>:<path> --pkgroot <org>:<path> <filenames> | linuxkit build` and dropped `linuxkit build -collect` 

There are some logs that im now writing to stderr. writing the result always to stdout works well.

I would suggest to add auto build dirty pkgs on `linuxkit generate --auto`.

There should also be a cmd for something like `linuxkit pkg build -t 2.3 ./somepkgdir` and to build all tags
