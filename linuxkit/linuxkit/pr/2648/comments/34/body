>  I think generate is my favourite

I like it too. My only concern is that, to some degree, build = generate. We are generating the output img, which is equivalent to building it. Nothing about "generate" implies "generate config file". But you could say the same thing about "transform". Maybe not "translate", but "translate" implies between two equal versions, which this is not.

`compile`? `process`? `preprocess`? `m4`? (ok, last one tongue in cheek....)
