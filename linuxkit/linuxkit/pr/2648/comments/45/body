Yes `New` in pkglib.Pkg would be awesome - but i think this needs some more work to build old hashes. [Here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects) are some good information. It would basically require `git cat-file -p hash` and then recursivly load the tree into a tmp dir for build. `src-d/go-git` has a bit nicer interface for that.
