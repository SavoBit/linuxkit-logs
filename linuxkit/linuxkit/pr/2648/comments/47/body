if there is
```
tags:
  - name: <2.1>
    hash: bb0c6ae2f12a1b55df24ebce2067784a931285df
```
i would like to be able to build the tag without finding out in which commit the hash is and checking it out. `generate` should not be in pkglib but needs a public interface to do all of its hash stuff and pkglib needs some refactor to be usable without cli. So im thinking if its the right moment to implement `src-d/go-git` along with it.
