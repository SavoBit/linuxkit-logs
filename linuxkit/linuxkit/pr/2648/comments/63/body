Okay, so I could live with this somewhere:
```
tags:
    - name: v1.0
        init: some_hash
        dhcp: some_hash
    - name: v2.0
        init: some_other_hash
        dhcp: another_hash
```
Its basically the same information as if tags -> hashes would be in build.yml(what i proposed) just at a different location (undecided if this is the better position or just a cache). The advantage is that you can e.g. hotfix v1.0 or what else for one pkg without influencing everything else.

@justincormack yes its writing to stdout and logging to stderr but i could also give it a `-o` multiflag if wished.
