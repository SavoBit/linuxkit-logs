I made `pkgInfo` public and moved it into the config namespace I put GlobalConfig in because `generate` needs to read the tags in the config before deciding which commitHash it is using in pkglib. Also created a constructor in `PkgInfo`, so that it doesnt need to be parsed twice.

This PR should be straightforward templating of `<tags>` in moby files onto tags in `build.yml` and having `<latest>` (could split this into its own commit if you prefer). Sorry for the confusion will tackle the other ideas by time :) generate is named `linuxkit bake` now. I will write some docs in the next days.
  
edit: walking the dir still needs to be fixed
