I agree with @ijc that we do want some templating. We had several discussions in the past, like https://github.com/moby/tool/issues/101 and https://github.com/moby/tool/pull/96. I like the explicit templating step `bake` now uses instead of substituting on the fly. So I think we agree on that portion and it would be nice to have this available.

Do you have an example for a baked YAML file. It would be useful if it would contain comments at the top stating that the file was generated, and ideally also the `HEAD` of the package repositories used to generate it. I would check in the generated file and this info would be useful.

As for version tags, for core LinuxKit packages, I think version tags on hub (like say `0.2`) should always correspond to git tags and we will release all the packages on LinuxKit as a whole, as @ijc said. As for non core LinuxKit packages, You can tag them in whatever way you like using `-hash` and/or `-release`. So if you want to version your packages that way, you can do that. I'm not sure we then want to support this with the templating mechanism. In any case this would be a separate functionality and ideally won't be rolled into the PR implementing the templating itself.
