> You get a "single" step with linuxkit tranform | linuxkit build -. I really do not want linuxkit build to do too much magic. It should just build what it is told to build.

That magic would also imply that one could not use `moby build` as an alternative/equivalent to `linuxkit build`, and I'm not sure of that is desired or not.
