There is `linuxkit pkg collect --pkgroot` which only does the pre-processing and outputs a valid yml and there is `linuxkit build -collect` which pre-processes and directly outputs the image (should output the valid yml aswell). `<latest>` gets replaced with the tree hash of pkg dir. E.g. there are uncommited changes in linuxkit/pkg/init then it gets replaced by `linuxkit/init:9250948d0de494df8a811edb3242b4584057cfe4-dirty`. I would like dirty hashes to be always auto-build for rapid development and other hashes if they are not available so that i dont have to manually build images.
