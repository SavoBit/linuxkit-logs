@deitch @rn @ijc Please recheck, adopting this could quit manually updating hashes upstream.
ive added default pkg roots in the global conf e.g.:
```
repos:
  - path: /go/src/github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit/pkg
  - path: /go/src/github.com/linuxkit/kubernetes/pkg
```
and a tags array in `build.yml` (might should be cached in a centralized db)
```
tags:
  - name: <2.1>
    hash: bb0c6ae2f12a1b55df24ebce2067784a931285df
```
if a container has `<latest>` tag it calculates the git hash of the tree and checks if the tree is dirty. 

There is `linuxkit pkg build -collect` which renders the template and outputs an image as usual.


I would like to autobuild the tags. it should be possible to recover a tree hash from .git into a temp dir to build pkgs that are not latest. Does someone have experience with that?

I also would like to be able to override the default config in `build.yml` by the tag field at some point.
