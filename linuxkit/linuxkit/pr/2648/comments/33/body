`linuxkit transform -o outputfile <filename> | linuxkit build -` does not seem to make sense to me

alternative naming would be `transform`, `translate`, `generate`. At the moment I think `generate` is my favourite, and we could add a comment to the generated file saying that is was auto-generated etc.

I think there are several use cases, like LCOW, where it would be nice to have a template and then generate the actual YAML and check it in.

I don't know what you mean by autobuild?
