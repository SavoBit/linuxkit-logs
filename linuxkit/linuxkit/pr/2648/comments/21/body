> Are the angle-brackets (<>) literally part of the tag here or just "syntax"?

a Tag is considered a Template and tried to be rendered if its surrounded by [<>](https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit/pull/2648/files#diff-54b90923dcb624b9443397970cfcb903R140), so that it doesnt conflict with tag names from normal docker images. `<latest>` is a special case. The Tag name in `build.yml` currently needs to be something like `<2.1>`.

If we just simply would use tags like `linuxkit/init:latest` from the registry, then images build on different times would be different without recognizing or reproducability for the user. `linuxkit/init:2.1` might be viable but having this information only in the registry ~is not really reproducable if the registry dies or something~. This could use the tags in `build.yml`. Personally i would still prefare to have the git hash of an image in a yml near the build to simplify checking out its source in case.

Ill try to document everything.
