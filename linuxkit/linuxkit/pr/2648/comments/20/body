> if a container has `<latest>` tag

Are the angle-brackets (`<>`) literally part of the tag here or just "syntax"?

I'm also not too clear on the difference between the tags here and those which can be part of the image on registry (i.e. what we currently populate with the hash when we push). Once LinuxKit has a release I was imagining we would push tagged images corresponding to that release to hub.

Maybe the `<>` is precisely to deal with that case?

If there was some documentation added by this PR describing things for the users then I might be less fuzzy on what was going on (I've not tried to work it out from the code).
