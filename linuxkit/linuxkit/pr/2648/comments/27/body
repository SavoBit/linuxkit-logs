You get a "single" step with `linuxkit tranform | linuxkit build -`. I really do not want `linuxkit build` to do too much magic. It should just build what it is told to build.

I don't want `latest` as in `docker run alpine` and you have no idea what you get. It makes no sense and defeats the purpose of LinuxKit. You should always build from known versions. What `linuxkit tranform` does, it would do the equivalent of `linuxkit pkg show-tag` for the package and use that hash and stick it into the YAML.
