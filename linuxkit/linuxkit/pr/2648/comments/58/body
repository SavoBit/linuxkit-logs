We intend to release linuxkit as a whole, with a single consistent set of packages, so the git tagging does (and should) apply to all packages in the repo.

If you want to version packages independently then separate repos would seem to be the right answer, although you could also push tags to hub without tagging in git if you wanted to tag independently. I think `linuxkit pkg push --release v1.1` will do that, but it's not something which gets tested so it might need fixes.

You could also maintain a `versions.yml` with tags (to be passed to `linuxkit bake`) inside the repository but outside the build directory (so editing it doesn't change the package hashes). There is certainly scope for enhancing your proposed `tags` datastructure to allow per-package tagging too.
