So `build -collect` = `lkt pkg collect > valid.yml && lkt build valid.yml` all in one?

I find it somewhat confusing, as the commands don't seem as instinctive. Basically, this all works only  if I am in "developer mode", i.e. I have the local go data installed. It creates a `lkt` run mode where it no longer is 100% standalone (well, docker run as well for creating output images, but slowly working on that).
