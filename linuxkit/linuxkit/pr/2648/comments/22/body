Then I am completely confused. I had thought the goal here was to have an ability to have a form of `yml` that can be pre-processed by `lkt` to turn into a "true" `yml` with hash versions etc. The only difference would be that the "pre" `yml` has a special "marker" tag that means, "replace me with the latest available version" (else we would just specify an exact version).

If so, wouldn't `pkg collect` find latest from the registry?

Are there 2 distinct behaviours?
