> My only concern is whether or not there is some existing YAML templating syntax/library/spec which we could be reusing here instead of inventing my own

Couldn't find anything (at first `tags` in the spec looked useful, until I realised that was for _types_ not values). Maybe aliases could be used but the idea of an application populating a default set of aliases doesn't seem to be considered.

Many projects seem to apply Go's `text/template` to their yaml (i.e. the `{{.Foo}}` stuff). Not sure how I feel about that but we could have `{{.Pkg.LinuxKit.Foo.latest}}` be handled that way perhaps (main benefit is we don't have to think about parsing and substitution too hard ourselves). Or probably `<>` is just fine.
