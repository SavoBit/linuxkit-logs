OK.

Agreed. I distinctly dislike docker's `latest` (even if I get the convenience).

In other words, `lkt transform` (`templatify`? :-) ) is a _developer_ tool, not an _end-user_ tool. It isn't used by end-users working with just the `lkt` binary, since they need the local clone. 

If that is true, is it really needed? Wouldn't the scripts already in here to modify the hashes be enough, or maybe a slightly modified version?

I see the benefit for end-users, where there aren't local repos and scripts and heaven-knows-what, so they might want a templating system to generate immutable from "give me the latest". But for devs who already have the entire repo, and thus all of the scripts, is it necessary? I get the convenience, but is it worth all _that_ much?
