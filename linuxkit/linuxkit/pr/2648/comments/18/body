I remain torn on this. I think I still like the idea of having the ability to tag an image with something special (like `<latest>`) and have it actively go and get the most recent version and populate it. it is less pure, but addresses a real use case.

On the other hand, something still feels a bit funny to me on this. If we are advocating immutable builds, then do we  _want_ the examples to have tags that need be pre-processed? Those are likely to become the most referenced starting points. Do we want to encourage mutable `yml`? The logical next step is just to have that stage 1 yml be accepted by `lkt build` and be pre-processed and built in one step, saving the output yml somewhere (local filesystem? inside image? tag?).

If I understand the implementation correctly, `pkg collect` would then look in local dirs as specified by the default or `--pkroot`? If so, I would need to have all of that installed if I want to run `lkt build` while using mutable tags, which would prevent the majority of users from using it. Most just want to install the binary and run it, not build it like we do. Why wouldn't it just talk to the registry directly?
