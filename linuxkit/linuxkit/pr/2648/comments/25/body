`linuxkit pkg collect` seems a misnomer as it is not an operation on a package. It confused me before and I was half way through writing a comment here...

Anyway, I would prefer if there was a distinct step, say:
```
linuxkit transform --pkgroot <org>:<path> --pkgroot <org>:<other path> foo.template.yml > foo.yml
linuxkit build foo.yml
```
The first would translate/tranform (not sure about the name) a *template* file into a valid YAML file by filling in the tags from the packages in the package route directories. And the second is the build as it is today. The `--pkgroot` format supports multiple orgs on hub, so for something like `--pkgroot  linuxkit:~/src/linuxkit/linuxkit/pkg --pkgroot linuxkit:~/src/linuxkit/kubernetes/pkg` means that the hash for `linuxkit/init` in the YAML would be looked up in two places.

The first step could also add the git HEAD hash as a comment at the start for `foo.yml`. If you really want to you can also do `linuxkit transform foo.template.yml | linuxkit build -`  but that way it's harder to have a record of actually got build.
