so i rethought this and the whole templating problem might just not fit into linuxkit. Nevertheless its very tedious to maintain hashes in moby configs somewhere upstream (I thinks its pretty noisy in this repo, too). So I tried to make this PR more statically. I will update my desktopless project this weekend and will use this solution from somewhere, tho i wouldnt be mad if you dont want to merge it here.
