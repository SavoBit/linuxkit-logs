dropping `linuxkit build -collect` and `--pkgroot <org>:<path>` sounds good to me.

I would suggest adding `linuxkit transform -o outputfile <filename> | linuxkit build -` or something. 

Can we agree on `transform` in general? 

Is it okay to keep templating the pkg tags for possible autobuild and also use the tags as image tag in the pkg build process later? 

Ill put autobuild on the roadmap for another PR.
