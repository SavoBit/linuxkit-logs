> When writing a moby yml I do not care about the container version and hashes (only if I specifically want to stay with a version) and would like to simplify the process of writing them. I also do not want to keep track of all pkg version I use downstream and update them manually when something changes upstream

I have a hard time understanding how that would work with immutable images (which is what LinuxKit is all about). 

I think this might be easier to understand if you gave sample `.yml` files for what it would look like if this were in place?
