I don't think there are objections to templating in general, my specific objection currently is that tags should not be defined in `pkg/*/build./yml`, that use case is satisfied by git tags and pushing the actual corresponding tags to hub (or tagging things in the local docker image repo for dev).

The `<latest>` thing seems clearly useful and I could also see the utility in being able to do things like:
```
linuxkit bake -D foo=abcdef foo.yml
```
(substitutes `org/pkg:<foo>` into `org/pkg:abcdef`)
or
```
linuxkit bake foo.yml vars.yml
```
where `vars.yml` includes the definitions in various ways for example something like the `tags` you are currently adding to `build.yml` (this is what I was expecting you were actually implementing here).

If this PR was just laying the ground work while implementing only `<latest>` I think it could be beaten into shape, the other ideas I mention above are subject to a bit more discussion.
