On second thought, I guess I can see it. `lkt` already contains all of the code for parsing the `yml`, so it fits there better than in some scripts that have to regenerate it. I have done that enough times with kube `yml`, e.g. and it always is messy.

OK, withdraw that question. But it _clearly_ is a developer tool for local usage.
