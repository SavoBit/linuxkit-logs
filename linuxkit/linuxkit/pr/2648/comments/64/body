@w9n please read my comment https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit/pull/2648#issuecomment-356576666. Could we initially focus on the templating stuff itself (ie replacing `<latest>` with the hash of the package). It seem separate from the version tags and both @ijc and myself are not sure if we should handle the version tags that way, ie by extending `build.yml`
