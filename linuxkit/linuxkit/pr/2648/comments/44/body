> the git methods are not public 

You appear to be using them to reimplement a subset of the pkglib functionality, which I expect will be rather error prone or at the very least subject to drift.

Instead you should use the public methods to create a `pkglib.Pkg` and use its methods to get the hash etc. If public methods for doing what you need in that regard that are missing we can add them but I think you just need `Tag()`, maybe a `New` which can be used directly rather than trying to go via `NewFromCLI` would be useful, might need some refactoring though.
