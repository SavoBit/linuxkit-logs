I'd just like to try to this pull request again. -- @razaborg had initiated the same issue on (#1675)
I believe that it is really helpful to most telco people even though the changes are very simple.

**- What I did**

I just recompiled the linuxkit moby kernel to get a SCTP support directly from the kernel.
I personally needed it in a docker for mac usecase to get SCTP support in my containers

**- How I did it**
I edited the kernel/kernel_config file to set the CONFIG_IP_SCTP option to y and remake the kernel.

**- How to verify it**

```
host>docker run -it debian
container>cat /proc/net/protocols
