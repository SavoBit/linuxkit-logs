This PR adds the ability to pull images from private repositories and registries during `linuxkit build`. It reuses the credentials provided with `docker login` and thus also utilises credential helpers such as the macOS keychain.

The actual code is quite small but required significant changes to the vendored packages. The first vendoring related commit updates all vendored packages to the same version as used by `docker/cli` version 18.06-ce. This required vendoring a whole bunch of new dependencies as well. The second vendoring related commit then adds the new packages needed to implement the authentication.

Also included is a minor tweak to use the `context` package (which wasn't available when this code was first written) and documentation updates.
