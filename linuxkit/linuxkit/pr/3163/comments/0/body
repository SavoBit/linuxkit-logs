- The 4.14.63 kernel has some important security updates against L1TF (CVE-2018-3615, CVE-2018-3620, CVE-2018-3646) and userspace-userspace SpectreRSB.
- Update the Intel ucode which quite possibly has more speculative execution fixes.
- Add support from 4.18.x kernels. The config was derived from 4.17.x but I additionally enabled:
    - XDP_SOCKETS
    - NFT_CONNLIMIT
    - IP_VS_MH
    - BPFILTER (as a module)
- The 4.18.x update also required a tweak to Docker.kconfig

As part of this update I also pushed the `kernel-bcc` package and have enabled the `bcc` test. While at it I also tidied up `Dockerfile.bcc`.

The x86_64 and arm64 kernels are build and pushed. There is an issue with the s390x machine which has been reported TLS handshake timeouts when talking to the notary server (and hub), and issue I have not seen on the other arches. I'll try to build the s390x kernel later
