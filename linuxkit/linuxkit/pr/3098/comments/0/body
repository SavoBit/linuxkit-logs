This updates the alpine base to alpine:3.8 and then all dependencies. resolves #3081 

Alpine 3.8 comes with go 1.10 so the special case for containerd and other packages has been removed.

Also removed is `gummiboot`. We don't use it anymore and it's no longer available for arm64.

All packages build and pushed for all arches.

The kernel build was also updated but I haven't rebuild the kernels (will do with the next kernel updates). However checked that arm64 kernel builds work with alpine:3.8 (fixes #3057)
