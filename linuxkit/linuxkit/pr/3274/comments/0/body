**- What I did**

Updated the [Gophercloud](https://github.com/gophercloud/gophercloud) dependencies and also bring in the ['utils'](https://github.com/gophercloud/utils) package.  This provides support for configuring access to OpenStack clouds as detailed in the [official documentation](https://docs.openstack.org/os-client-config/latest/user/configuration.html).  It maintains compatibility by allowing users to specify credentials via environment variables.

I've removed the command-line options for specifying access and authentication-related settings as I believe these are redundant.

By relying on this package we can simplify the code required to interact with OpenStack's APIs. Support is also provided upstream for self-signed and insecure SSL configurations.

**- How to verify it**

Tested with a public cloud running OpenStack 'Rocky':

```shell
nick@deadline:..om/yankcrime/linuxkit> bin/linuxkit push openstack \
    ~/Temp/linuxkitopenstack.qcow2
