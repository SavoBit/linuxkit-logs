Thanks for the quick turnaround. I've build and pushed the updated metadata package. Could you add a commit which updates the YAML files to the new version. There is a script, so in the top-level directory something like:
```
./scripts/update-component-sha.sh --image linuxkit/metadata:aa4f93f6695ebe21a3539b5effed27889d7c4dfb
```
should do the right thing.

Once that update PR passes CI, I'm happy to merge it.
