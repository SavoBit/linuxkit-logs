Fixes #2487 (Not totally yet, WIP)

**- What I did**
I added support for scaleway provider. Right now I only did the push command. 
Some modifications are still needed, but I wanted some feedback.
**- How I did it**
I used to Scaleway Go API to implement the provider.
The tricky part was the process of the image creation since Scaleway relies on snapshot to make images. 
Basically I did:
  * Create a temporary instance with a second volume attached
  * Copy the iso file to the instance via ssh
  * Write the iso to the second volume using dd command
  * Terminate the instance
  * Snapshot the second volume
  * Create the image from snapshot

**- How to verify it**
Pull and try :grin:
