argh, we had the same dance earlier this week on a different PR.Sorry, this is going to be a little bit tedious. Could you:

- Drop commit with changes to the YAML files.
- Rebase your PR to master
- Force push

I will then rebuild the meta data package and your can do another update to the YAMLs with a force push. I'm surprised git can't merge the changes...
