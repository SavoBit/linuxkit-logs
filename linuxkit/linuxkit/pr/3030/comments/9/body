Didn't we see something like this once before, ages ago. It was something like pkg had changed in such a way that `pkg build` was actually building some things which had huge disk requirements to build (which would be cleaned up on failure, hiding it from post-mortem investigations). If the images are built and pushed to hub then the `pkg build` short circuits into a `pull` and you avoid the issue.

The logs here does seem to run out of space while doing a package build, I haven't spotted which package it is yet though.
