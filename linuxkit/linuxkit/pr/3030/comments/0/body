When busybox's reboot processing occurs in init, it runs all SHUTDOWN
actions that are defined in inittab.  Once those are complete, it will
trigger either a halt, poweroff, or reboot, depending upon what signal
is received.  The mechanism that's used to shell out through inittab
does not allow us to pass through exactly which invocation was
requested.

Due to the way that rc.shutdown works, it invokes the poweroff action
for any and all SHUTDOWN callbacks, whether they're a reboot, poweroff,
or halt.  Instead of handling the reboot(2) syscall in rc.shutdown,
return after killing and unmounting and let busybox's init process
decide which reboot(2) action to use.

**- What I did**

Since the `::shutdown` action in inittab can be invoked for multiple different types of shutdowns, use a dummy argument to `rc.shutdown` that does not trigger a reboot or poweroff.  Let init decide once the unmount and kill are complete.

**- How I did it**

Modified how `::shutdown` is calling `rc.shutdown` in /etc/inittab.

**- How to verify it**

I verified this by invoking `reboot`, `poweroff`, and `halt` and validating that each triggered the desired action.

**- Description for the changelog**

Ensure that reboot triggers a reboot instead of a poweroff.
