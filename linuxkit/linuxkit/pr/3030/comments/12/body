If someone builds/pushes init then I bet it will pass.

It seems to be doing a `make -J«something»` over `pkg/*` I wonder if that is provoking it to use more disk space then is available for `/var/lib/docker/`, `pkg/init` seems pretty simple so surprising if it blew the disk space all by itself (e.g. the apk add is just adding 117M).
