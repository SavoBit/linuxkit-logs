With PR #3030 the behaviour of poweroff/halt is changed. This
test relies on on-shutdown containers to be executed to display
the test result (service containers have their stdout redirected).
Use 'poweroff' (note, no '-f') to ensure that:
- the machine actually powers off
- the on-shutdown container is executed

Note, there are subtle differences between 'poweroff' and 'halt'
between hypervisors. With HyperKit, 'halt' actually works, but with
qemu/kvm, with 'halt' the process does not exit.
