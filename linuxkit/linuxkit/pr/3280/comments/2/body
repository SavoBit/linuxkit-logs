The diff in GH and git does not look right. Can you do a `git mv provider_cdrom.go provider_iso.go` and then make the changes. That way one actually sees the differences. Or even split this up into two commits. One which does the rename and one which adds the new functionality? That way one can see the actual changes.

It would also be good if the commit message explains more of the rationale for this change.
