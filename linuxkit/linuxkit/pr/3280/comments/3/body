`git mv` is no different to `git rm && git add` in terms of what is stored in the repo, there is no specific metadata recorded about such things. The "move" and "copy" display is entirely a presentation layer thing. IOW `git mv` wouldn't help here -- it's just that the old and new files differ enough that GH didn't guess there was a move involved while rendering the diff.

For the CLI you can control the heuristics a bit with the `-M` and `-C` options to `git show`, I suppose that isn't possible in the GH webui though.

Making it two commits would indeed be one way to avoid the problem though. and +1 to better commit messages...
