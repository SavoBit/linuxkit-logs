There is a challenge with USB devices, I ended up having to do this:

```yaml
onboot:
  - name: modprobe-usb-storage
    image: linuxkit/modprobe:v0.6
    command: ["modprobe", "usb-storage"]
  - name: wait-usb-storage
    image: linuxkit/alpine:3683c9a66cd4da40bd7d6c7da599b2dcd738b559
    binds:
      - /dev:/dev
    command:
      - sh
      - -c
      - until test -b /dev/sdc ; do sleep 1 ; done
  - name: metadata
    image: errordeveloper/metadata:9250ccfc8a4ba879989281b5f782bae2551521b9
```

I might find a better way, but this is what I have to do at the moment.
