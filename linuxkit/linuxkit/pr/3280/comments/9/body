Sorry, I meant that the diff is *now* much easier to read.

But the code is mounting every disk in the system. And only later, during probe, it goes through the providers and stops on the first suitable on. This doesn't look nice. Why not mount only during probe and stop mounting once a suitable device is found. I dn't think we want to make it more complicated with filesystem probing in whatnot, just stop mounting once you found a suitable device.
