This seems to have fallen through the cracks. @djs55 care to review this as this mostly touches code you added?

@teeg82 once this is reviewed, can you add a commit which updates the YAML files using the `linuxkit/logwrite` package with the output of `linuxkit pkg show-tag .` in the `./pkg/logwrite` directory (using `./scripts/update-component-sha.sh`. This will cause CI to pick up the new package and it will fail as it has not been signed/pushed yet. I will do that and then kick CI again
