fixes #3052

**- What I did**

remove duplicate files from output so docker can import images

**- How I did it**

Write tar output to a tempfile, then read it back in and write the contents to the actual output while removing duplicates.

If a duplicate file has different contents the build process will error

I tried writing to a buffer instead of a file and received unexpected EOFs when trying to read it back.

**- How to verify it**

```
linuxkit build -format docker sshd.yml
docker import sshd.docker
```

**- Description for the changelog**

remove duplicate files from output so docker can import images
