**- What I did**
Removed size arg from the tools/mkimage-gcp/make-gcp.sh script virt-make-fs command as this fixed size was failing with larger images.

**- How I did it**
delete key

**- How to verify it**
We have a large file included in our 'files:' directive, so this is where we found this issue. When making a large (>1GB) image with the old make-gcp script you'd get a "failed: exit code 1". We no longer get this error with the included change.

**- Description for the changelog**
Removed size arg from mkimage-gcp script.
