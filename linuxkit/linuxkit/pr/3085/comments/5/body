Thanks, looking good. 

I've set up signing for `linuxkit/memlogd` and build and pushed both `linuxkit/init` and `linuxkit/memlogd`,

Could you, in a separate commit, update the YAMLs to use:
```
linuxkit/init:4fa16c9045d60732dadb04f5d7f5c18d83c6551e
```
and
```
linuxkit/memlogd:883f0d46e7d3ae2d787e8acb496da115a4707cbc
```

Can you update the *all* the YAMLs with the new `linuxkit/init` as that way the CI will test it. You can use `./scripts/update-component-sha.sh` for that.
