I've force pushed another update with
- `linuxkit` added to the socket name
- `<origin>` in the docs renamed to `<log>`
- `;` banned from log names (including check in `memlogd` and test case)
- slightly confusing `Open` `Path` code untangled a bit
- use of `io.WriteCloser` rather than `*os.File`
- open the log files with `WRONLY` rather than `RDWR`
