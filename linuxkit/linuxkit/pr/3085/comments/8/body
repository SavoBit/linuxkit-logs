It's because of a slight semantic change. Consider the `binfmt` yaml:
```
onboot:
  - name: binfmt
    image: linuxkit/binfmt:0f73915a3fe365615a10a811f5b83303f48949d5
  - name: test
    image: alpine:3.7
    binds:
      - /check.sh:/check.sh
      - /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc:/binfmt_misc
    command: ["sh", "./check.sh"]
  - name: poweroff
    image: linuxkit/poweroff:d75d94d9603bde9ab95b914deed0d069d05d8b20
    command: ["/bin/sh", "/poweroff.sh", "10"]
```
Previously [the log files were dumped one by one](https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit/blob/2c8438f64ba737b88bd1f69b87c2790a4a9cfd3a/pkg/init/cmd/service/runc.go#L155) inside the `for` loop, but here the [log files are dumped at the end](https://github.com/djs55/linuxkit/blob/649cff9a44efb2daaa4dd6af47eba08c571ede23/pkg/init/cmd/service/runc.go#L155). This means the `poweroff` happens before the call to `DumpAll` so the logs are missing. I'll see if I can refactor it to put the old behaviour back tomorrow. I think I can easily change `DumpAll()` into `Dump(log string)` for the file case but I'll have to download the logs from `memlogd` and filter to avoid repetition to get the same behaviour there. Not a big amount of change. Sorry for the signing inconvenience!
