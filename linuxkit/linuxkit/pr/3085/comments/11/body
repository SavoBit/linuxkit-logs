@rn I've rebased with this patch: https://github.com/djs55/linuxkit/commit/c45427711b770cf793601dd9fb31c3e8a3ce03b7 and updated the `linuxkit/init` hash (which won't exist but I think it's got the correct value)

I tested this locally with the `binfmt` test which now exits with code 0 (and I can see the `SUCCESS` in the output). I also checked the `logging.yml` by adding a 2nd `onboot` container and checking the logs appear once per thing.
