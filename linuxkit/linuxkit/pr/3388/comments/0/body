- I started with updating tools/alpine/Dockerfile to use alpine:3.10 as base image.
- Then had to update the packages file to remove obsolete, and include some new packages.
- Also updated containerd and iucode to the latest release versions.
- Proceeded, and succeeded to build this image locally.
- Fixed the Dockerfile since with the new Go version, you need to use `go vet`
- Fixed the location/package name of golint as well
- Updated all references to the alpine image within the project to the (temporary) hash in order to test
- did a `make` on tools
- did a `make` on linuxkit

Since this is my first PR for Docker / linuxkit, I would welcome any guidance in getting this PR up to the required standards. I've read contribution guidelines, and tried to follow as good as possible.
