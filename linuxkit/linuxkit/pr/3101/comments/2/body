I've been running the `hardirqs.py` and the `task_switch.lua` scripts as sanity checks but I haven't attempted to use any of my own scripts or complete a complicated kernel debugging task yet.  Were there specific scripts that had proved problematic in the past for you?

Unrelated: I noticed that some of the delta in the earlier commits in this change caused a bit of unnecessary confusion.  Is it preferable to collapse the change set into a single delta, or are multiple smaller commits the preferred style for this project?
