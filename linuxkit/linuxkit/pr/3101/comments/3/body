Great to hear that the samples work. Last time I tried I wasn't that lucky and basically nothing worked. Maybe it would be good to add a quick test under `./tests/cases/040_packages` for one of the samples.

As for the patches, I think the current break down is good: 1) make it work again, 2) move it, 3) add docs, 4) remove the old stuff. I think the main confusion was the inclusion of pulling a image from some random registry. If we have a `linuxkit/alpine` package with all the deps in there it would be good to add a 1.5 step to use that. But these are really just cosmetic bits.
