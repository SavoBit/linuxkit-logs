Thanks for picking this up. I've tried a couple of times a few months ago but had issues compiling it against musl and other bits. Once I had it compiling I also had issues running stuff. Have you tried some of the samples?

I made a few comments and also this needs to be build with `linuxkit/alpine` as Justin pointed out, but generally I'd be ok with carrying this forward. It's good to have these tools available!
