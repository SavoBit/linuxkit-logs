I've updated this to use the `linuxkit/alpine:8a89682421abf0d886d777235a05f4a04a736df2` base image, which includes the new packages.  This should address all of the review comments, modulo getting the tests working.  The tests that are checked in pass for me when I run them manually.  IIUC, the blocker here is finding a way to trigger the building of kernel-bcc package for the test.  (It's not presently built by default.)
