Added a test case, but the test's image.yml depends upon the availability of the `kernel-bcc` package, which is not presently being built by default.  Is there a mechanism to trigger a specific portion of the kernel build so that the tests may consume it?  Presumably we'd need to do this if we were to ever write a test case for the `kernel-perf` image, too?
