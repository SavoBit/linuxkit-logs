**- What I did**

This PR is an opening gambit for moving the bcc build out of projects and into the kernel build.

**- How I did it**

This leveraged the existing work done earlier by @rn.  The change collapses the dual stage build into a single stage that builds a bcc container after the kernel headers have been generated by an earlier stage of the kernel build.

**- How to verify it**

I've tested by building against all versions of the kernel supported by linuxkit.  Once built, I placed the bcc package into one of the init layers and then validated that I could run both Python and luaj scripts that are packaged from the bcc build.

**- Description for the changelog**

Move bcc to the kernel build.
