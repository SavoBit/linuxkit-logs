**- What I did**

Extracted the building of grub from the various places that use it - `tools/mkimage-raw-efi`, `tools/mkimage-iso-efi`, `tools/mkimage-qcow2-efi` - into its own package `linuxkit/grub` from source `tools/grub`, and just copy over the compiled `*.EFI` image as needed.

This will speed up builds of those images, and more importantly make it easier to move them to upstream grub and off of orphaned CoreOS grub, when ready.

**- How I did it**

Moved the common Dockerfile info over and updated the Dockerfiles in each of those packages.

**- How to verify it**

1. Build the grub image
2. Build the `mkimage-*-efi` image(s)
3. `lkt build -format tar | docker run -i <your mkimage>`
4. Boot

**- Description for the changelog**
<!--
Write a short (one line) summary that describes the changes in this
pull request for inclusion in the changelog:

Centralize common grub builds.


**- A picture of a cute animal (not mandatory but encouraged)**

**Note:** The images have not been fully pushed to docker hub quite yet. `arm64` pushes have been stuck. Will comment here when ready.

This will simplify much of #3309
