```

  * compat: don't clash with get_random_u32 backports
  
  This should allow running on recent Qualcomm msm8998 kernels.
  
  * wg-quick: determine IPs when saving interface
  * wg-quick: darwin: add multiple IP addresses
  * wg-quick: freebsd: configure as p2p link
  * wg-quick: darwin: set DNS servers after delay on route change
  
  Usual set of wg-quick changes, since the recent cross platform additions.
  
  * curve25519: x86_64: satisfy sparse
  * curve25519: x86_64: make symbol static
  * crypto: consistent constification
  
  Small cleanups in the crypto primitives.
  
  * chacha20poly1305: split up into separate files
  * chacha20poly1305: combine stack variables into union
  * chacha20poly1305: test scattergather functions too
  * chacha20poly1305: test for authtag failure
  
  We've reorganized our chapoly implementation and added lots of new tests as
  well. The generic C chacha should be slightly faster in the process.
  
  * poly1305: mips: compute S on fly
  
  Small speedup on MIPS.
  
  * device: do not assume dst is always valid
  
  Fixes a crash when forwarding packets from devices that use flow offloading.
  
  * tools: constanter time encoding
  
  Not essential, but nice to have.
