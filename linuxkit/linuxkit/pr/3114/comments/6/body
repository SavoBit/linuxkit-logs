Why do we have both the symlink and things written to `/var/run/onboot.001-foo.log` though? Surely either there should be no symlink and `/var/run/onboot.001-foo.log` is correct _or_ the logs should be written to `/var/run/onboot/001-foo.log` (or equivalently directly to `/run/log/onboot/`).

Not sure why the logger in use should matter, if it isn't writing logs then no logs should be written (and the symlink is redundant but harmless) or they are writing logs and should do so to a consistent place.
