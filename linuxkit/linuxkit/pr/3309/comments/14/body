I stand corrected. I had a slightly longer conversation with Matthew. It appears that `linux` command uses the legacy entrypoint into the kernel, which misses certain critical elements (tcg2 logs, memory overwrite protection, some other things which Matthew can run rings around me on), while `linuxefi` uses the EFI entrypoint into the kernel, enabling the above (in addition to SecureBoot shim support).

Our choices basically are:

* Stick with the orphaned coreos grub until the EFI entrypoint is upstreamed.
* Move to master and live with the lacking functionality.

Thoughts?
