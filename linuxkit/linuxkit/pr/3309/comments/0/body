**- What I did**

* Separate the building of grub into its own modular element, as opposed to in each of the 3 tools that require it - `mkimage-iso-efi`, `mkimage-raw-efi`, `mkimage-qcow2-efi` . We do _not_ use grub for bios.
* Replace dependency on the largely abandoned coreos/grub fork with the maintained upstream grub. In the last several months to year, the same team that did much of the work on coreos/grub has upstreamed the important parts.

Note that this is compiling directly from master (a specific commit). We are not using the official release - which is available in `apk` - since that is based on the most recent release, 2.02, which is almost 2 years old.

As discussed with @rn and @justincormack .

Question: would like some additional testing, even if only smoke-testing style, "can we build it and get the image we want" (final OCI image has a single file in it). Any thoughts on it?

**- How I did it**

Build `tools/linuxkit/grub`

**- How to verify it**

```
cd tools/grub
docker build -t linuxkit/grub .
```

Or more properly:

```
lkt pkg build .
```

**- Description for the changelog**
