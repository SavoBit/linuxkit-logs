So it seems, I cannot sign it due to something with trust. Push worked, just not signing.

Is it that we need a new hub repo set up correctly with trust for `linuxkit/grub`?

```
$ DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST_REPOSITORY_PASSPHRASE=$(...) lkt pkg push tools/grub
Building and pushing "linuxkit/grub:9aaae2ad8ab52206ebb5c014d27bffeddee8c9ff"
