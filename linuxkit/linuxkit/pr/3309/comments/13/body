The impact of losing `linuxefi` is limited to loss of the shim. In other words, if you try to use a system that has `SecureBoot` enabled, it will fail. All other cases will boot, and `tpm` support is fully in.

I am willing to live with that.

The only remaining issue, then, is my system with no video output. I do not yet know if this is something due to the changes in grub, or something else entirely. Can @rn or @justincormack weigh in here? Other than that, I think this is ready to go.
