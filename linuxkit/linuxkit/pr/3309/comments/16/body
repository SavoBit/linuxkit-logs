In that case, I am going to do the following:

1. Take the "centralization of grub" from here, but rather than going to grub upstream, go to the orphaned CoreOS grub.
2. Leave this PR open (or open a new one) that switches to upstream, and leave that one open until we get `linuxefi` module support in there.

Once that is in place, I would appreciate some assistance in figuring out the empty boot screen issue.
