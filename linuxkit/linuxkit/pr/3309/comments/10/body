Update: I managed to get it to build correctly off of upstream grub, and build the various `mkimage-*-efi` images. Still running into 2 problems:

1. Refuses to boot (or boots but has no output). 
    * With `lkt run qemu`, I get the usual `qemu-system-x86_64: warning: host doesn't support requested feature: CPUID.80000001H:ECX.svm [bit 2]` but nothing after that, even as `qemu` appears to be running contentedly.
    * With virtual box, I get `error: invalid video mode specification: text. booting in blind mode` and no output after that. I am sure I am doing something wrong....
2. While the tpm support definitely has been upstreamed into grub (at least into master, not the 2-yr-old 2.02 release), it is as-yet-unclear if the full EFI support has been upstreamed. Most distributions have some form of `linuxefi/initrdefi` custom module (including coreos/grub). I am trying to determine if that was upstreamed.
