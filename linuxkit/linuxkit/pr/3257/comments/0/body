**- What I did**
I simply tried to execute the ```linuxkit build -format=vmdk -name docker examples/docker.yml``` and got: 
```
Extract kernel image: linuxkit/kernel:4.14.91
FATA[0000] Failed to extract kernel image and tarball: Could not pull image linuxkit/kernel:4.14.91: could not initialize Docker API client
```
**- How to verify it**
export DOCKER_HOST=localhost:2376 and try the build command. Once the error is returned it adds an extra info to figure out what went wrong:
```
Extract kernel image: linuxkit/kernel:4.14.91
FATA[0000] Failed to extract kernel image and tarball: Could not pull image linuxkit/kernel:4.14.91: could not initialize Docker API client, err: unable to parse docker host `localhost:2376`
```

**- Description for the changelog**
Fixes an issue to initialize the Docker API client when the DOCKER_HOST does not start with a protocol.
