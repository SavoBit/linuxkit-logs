fixes #3295 

**- What I did**

* Rebuilt from `alpine:3.9`, which includes `gcc:8.x` (`alpine:3.8` was off of `gcc:6.x`)
* Moved to latest commit of `coreos/grub` from a few months ago that fixes the indentation issue
* Applied a patch directly to fix an issue on `x86_64`
* Updated the dependent tools images: `tools/mkimage-iso-efi`, `tools/mkimage-raw-efi`, `tools/mkimage-qcow2-efi`
* Updated `src/cmd/linuxkit/moby/output.go` to use these latest images

**- How I did it**

**- How to verify it**

Run, build, see that outputs are bootable.
