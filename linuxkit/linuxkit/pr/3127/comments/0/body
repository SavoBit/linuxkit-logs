**- What I did**

Trying to hack on containerd with LinuxKit I found that I could _almost_ do `CONTAINERD_REPO=... CONTAINERD_COMMIT=... make iid` (in `tools/alpine`) to build from a custom containerd repo. But not quite, so I made this possible ðŸ˜‰.

Note: There are a few similar places where it might be useful to be able to override repo/commit - not sure if it makes sense to also add those?

**- How I did it**

- replaced `git clone`'s reference to the containerd repo with a reference to `$CONTAINERD_REPO` (which was unreferenced before)
- changed `ENV` to `ARG` so the 2 variables could be set as `--build-arg`s
- added the appropriate `--build-arg` flags to the `docker build` command

**- How to verify it**

```console
$ cd tools/alpine; CONTAINERD_REPO=https://github.com/hairyhenderson/containerd.git CONTAINERD_COMMIT=master make iid
...
Step 21/39 : RUN mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/containerd &&   cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/containerd &&   git clone ${CONTAINERD_REPO} &&   cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/containerd/containerd &&   git checkout $CONTAINERD_COMMIT
 ---> Running in e4adacf8228c
Cloning into 'containerd'...
Already on 'master'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

```
