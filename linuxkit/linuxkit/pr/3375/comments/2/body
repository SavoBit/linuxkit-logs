Thanks for the patch. I've build, pushed, signed the updated packages. Could you, in a separate commit, update the use of the packages in `src/cmd/linuxkit/moby/output.go` to:
```
linuxkit/mkimage-vhd:07b7cd3d598bce874d6ec05294580e10f1045551
linuxkit/mkimage-vmdk:3bddab9dd518ee0007b16ad00e60ffdbb76219c0
```

That way CI will pick up the changes and test them.

Thanks
