**- What I did**
Fixed an issue where an image manifest that contained files larger than 1G caused `vmdk` and `vhd` formatted builds to fail.  

**- How I did it**
Removed the 1G `virt-make-fs` size specification from the `make-vmdk` and `make-vhd` build scripts. 

**- How to verify it**
- Build a new `mkimage-*` Docker images for vmdk or vid outputs. 
- Modify [output.go](https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit/blob/master/src/cmd/linuxkit/moby/output.go) to use the new Docker images. 
- Build the linuxkit binary.
- Use the newly built binary to run `linuxkit build` against an image manifest that contains files larger than 1G.
- Observe massive success.

**- Description for the changelog**
Fixes an issue that causes builds to fail for image manifests containing large files.
