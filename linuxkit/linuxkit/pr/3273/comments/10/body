> (getting meaningless error from hyperkit)

What type of errors? Might be related to https://github.com/moby/hyperkit/issues/226 which was fixed a while back. I don't know if this has been pulled into the hyperkit shipped with Docker Desktop. Maybe try the qemu backend, where latest versions should also use the hypervisor framework for acceleration
