Last time I looked at ZFS one issue was that the version of the tools which came with Alpine did not quite match the version of the kernel module and there was some doubt if they'd work.

We currently do not build official images for ZFS and therefore don't have it in the CI because none of us fancied taking it up with the lawyers (I still don't) so we just provide the mechanism to build it yourself.
