**- What I did**

I fixed the `getty` and `sshd` `motd` to report the correct `ctr` command usage, as the indicated namespace is incorrect.
I also added two new FAQ entries adding a bit more information that I gathered while troubleshooting my issue in #3087. I think this could help other users as not everybody knows exactly how `linuxkit` or `containerd` works.

**- How I did it**

With my hands, my brain and a text editor :)

**- How to verify it**

I'm not a native English speaker, so you probably should proof-read what I wrote :)
