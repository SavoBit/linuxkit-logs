This adds adds a new `sources` field to the `build.yml` where one can specify additional source directories for the package build outside the package directory. This is useful for sharing files, such as vendored go code, between packages.

If `sources` are specified, the package hash is calculated as the `sha1` of the strings of the git tree hashes of all the externals sources and the package directory. Therefore, `sources` need to be under git revision control.

`sources` are specified as a `src:dst` pair, where `src` can be a relative path the package directory and `dst` is the destination with the docker build context.

The `sources` features is implemented by `tar`ing up (and rewriting the paths) of the sources and pipe them to `stdin` of the `docker` process used to build the package.

There should be no changes for packages not using the `sources` features.
