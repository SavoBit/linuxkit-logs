**- What I did**

We already support `http_proxy`/`HTTP_PROXY`, `https_proxy`/`HTTPS_PROXY`, `no_proxy`/`NO_PROXY` env vars to add build args. This does:

1. Adds support for `ftp_proxy` docker standard build-arg
2. Adds support for non-docker standard but socks standard `all_proxy`/`ALL_PROXY`
3. Adds documentation about using proxies when building
4. Fixes bug in building args wherein if build args are present, has them twice and overrides existing args.

**- How I did it**

Changed `src/cmd/linuxkit/pkglib/docker.go` and `docs/packages.md`

**- How to verify it**

Run `lkt pkg build` with the env vars set and `-v` to see the output
