> So this PR doesn't care about the backend of the /dev/hwrng, it just establishes a bridge between the /dev/random and /dev/hwrng in guest: read entropy from /dev/hwrng and feed it to /dev/random

And your plan then is to have a future PR that will replace the blind matching of `urandom` (host) -> `hwrng` (guest) with something more intelligent like `hwrng` (host if it exists) -> `hwrng` (guest)?

This would bring `rngd` in line with its usual job, which is `hwrng`/`hwrandom` -> `random`.

Looks good to me, but like to get input from another someone with lower-level understanding. I believe @justincormack did the original `rngd` implementation?
