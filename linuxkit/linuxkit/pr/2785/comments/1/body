@justincormack @ijc @rn, currently we always pass a `virtio-rng` device backed by host's `/dev/urandom` to the guest, that makes the guest's `/dev/hwrng` always valid, in this case the entropy from the `/dev/hwrng` maybe not good enough for some security-sensitive applications. My proposal here is, if there's a real RNG hardware device in the host, we can para-virtualise that to the guest, else we do nothing, thus the `/dev/hwrng` in the guest will give the effective information of the quality of the entropy source. Any comments about that?
