> I am also slightly confused about /dev/hwrng in the case of virtio rng as it seems to exist and work, but in fact the kernel talks to it directly and AFAIK rngd does not need to read it from userspace, but I am not 100% sure about this, need to look into it.

Oh, so it isn't just me who is confused? I feel better now.

I always thought `rngd`'s job was to read from a hardware random device (like `/dev/hwrng`) and feed `/dev/random`. Perhaps not?
