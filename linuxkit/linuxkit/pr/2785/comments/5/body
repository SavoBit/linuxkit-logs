That's different, this PR just uses the entropy from `/dev/hwrng` to feed `/dev/random` in guest, so some security applications can take use of `/dev/random` to generate like keys, the PR doesn't care about the entropy quality in `/dev/hwrng`. But if the guest can realize its `/dev/hwrng` is backed by a real RNG device or not, we can make better decision how to handle it.
