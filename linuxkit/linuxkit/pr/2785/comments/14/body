`linuxkit run` is not designed to be the final answer for production, it does not offer the full set of options you may want on a platform. We are not going to try to determine policy for rng, we do not have enough information to decide, the user needs to configure it.

I am also slightly confused about `/dev/hwrng` in the case of virtio rng as it seems to exist and work, but in fact the kernel talks to it directly and AFAIK `rngd` does not need to read it from userspace, but I am not 100% sure about this, need to look into it.
