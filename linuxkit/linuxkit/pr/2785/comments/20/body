Hello @justincormack @ijc @rn and @deitch , I just forced an update of this PR. In this PR, I addressed some comments from you guys and the important is to move the hardware RNG code as arch agnostic. This PR also has a framework to support both hardware RNG device and some RNG instruction such as it does on x86_64.  For endlessness, since the random number is not related with that, I still use it since this will make the code easy, but you guys have some better one to do that, I am happy to embrace that ðŸ˜¸
