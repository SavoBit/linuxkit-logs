**- What I did**
Enable the `rngd` service on AArch64 in case of a hardware RNG device available
**- How I did it**
Check the `/dev/hwrng` and use it as the entropy source to feed the `/dev/random` if `/dev/hwrng` is the real character device of a RNG hardware.
**- How to verify it**
1. `linuxkit pkg build -org m1130 rngd/`
2.  `docker run --privileged --rm --device /dev/hwrng m1130/rngd:842e5e8ece7934f0cab9fd0027b595ff3471e5b9-dirty`
3. On an AArch64 platform which has a real RNG device such as Cavium ThunderX, we can see the `/sbin/rngd` is running inside the docker.
