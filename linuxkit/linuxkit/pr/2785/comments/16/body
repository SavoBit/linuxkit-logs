> I am also slightly confused about /dev/hwrng in the case of virtio rng as it seems to exist and work, but in fact the kernel talks to it directly and AFAIK rngd does not need to read it from userspace, but I am not 100% sure about this, need to look into it.

IMO, /dev/hwrng generate the entropy saved in kernel space, while the entropy pool that  `/dev/random` used is also in kernel space, technically we can transmit the entropy generated by `/dev/hwrng` into the entropy pool of `/dev/random`, but actually there isn't a channel to do that in current kernel implementation, that's why we need the `rngd` to do that.
