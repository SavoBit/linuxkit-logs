Right, that's another topic, it's my proposal.

For our current solution, the `/dev/hwrng` always valid, as you said, it's backed by `/dev/urandom` in the host. So this PR doesn't care about the backend of the `/dev/hwrng`, it just establishes a bridge between the `/dev/random` and `/dev/hwrng` in guest: read entropy from `/dev/hwrng` and feed it to `/dev/random`.
