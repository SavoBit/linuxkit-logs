@justincormack I had to chance the kernel config check script quite a bit, would be good to have another pair of eyes on that change. 

Also had to disable the docker/moby kernel config check because CFQ is no longer in 5.x https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/38887 (also see https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit/issues/3308 which I will pick up with the next update)
