If you are using `DOCKER_HOST` to flip between local and remote then being able to just set-and-forget `DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY` (which it appears is what is happening here) would be nice...

Likewise if the script is unaware of the specifics of `DOCKER_HOST` but definitely knows it wants TLS to be verified if it is being used...

Seems like a regression in the CLI to me.
