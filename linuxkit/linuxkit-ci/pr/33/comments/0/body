- Docker Cloud is gone; use GCP hosting instead.
- Update admin list.
- Remove some unused volumes.

Also, it seems we need to unset `DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY` when using a socket now, otherwise the `push.sh`
script fails with:

    error during connect:
      Get https://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.38/services:
        dial tcp: lookup /var/run/docker.sock: no such host
